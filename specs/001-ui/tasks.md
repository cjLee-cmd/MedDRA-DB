# Tasks: CIOMS-I Form Data Management Web UI

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED per constitution Principle III (Test-First Development). All database migration tests, API contract tests, and integration tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Backend tests: `backend/tests/contract/`, `backend/tests/integration/`, `backend/tests/unit/`
- Database scripts: `backend/src/db/migrations/`
- Frontend manual test cases: `tests/e2e/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (uses read-only models)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 2 models being implemented - Can share model files
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Depends on User Story 3 create methods - Extends models with update/delete
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Depends on User Story 3 create methods - Reuses form creation logic for bulk import

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (TDD required) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before API endpoints
- API endpoints before frontend
- Frontend components before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes:
  - User Story 1 (database) can proceed independently
  - User Story 2 (browse/search) can start after US1 models created OR in parallel with different developers
  - Models within each story marked [P] can be implemented in parallel
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can be written in parallel
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# After Foundational phase complete, launch all models for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Implement backend/src/models/form.py with Form model"
Task: "Implement backend/src/models/patient.py with PatientInfo model"
Task: "Implement backend/src/models/adverse_reaction.py with AdverseReaction model"
Task: "Implement backend/src/models/drug.py with SuspectedDrug model"
Task: "Implement backend/src/models/causality_assessment.py with CausalityAssessment model"
Task: "Implement backend/src/models/lab_result.py with LabResult model"

# Then launch form_service.py (depends on all models above)
Task: "Implement backend/src/services/form_service.py with get_all_forms, get_form_by_id, search_forms business logic"

# Then launch API endpoints and frontend in parallel:
Task: "Implement backend/src/api/forms.py with GET endpoints"
Task: "Create frontend/src/js/forms/form-view.js with FormView class"
Task: "Implement frontend/src/js/forms/form-list.js with FormList class"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Database Schema)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Verify database schema with sample data
5. Deploy/demo if ready (database foundation established)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Database) ‚Üí Test schema ‚Üí Validate (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Browse/Search) ‚Üí Test search ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (Add Forms) ‚Üí Test create ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Edit Forms) ‚Üí Test update ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 (Import) ‚Üí Test bulk ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Database)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 models (can start in parallel)
   - Developer C: Frontend foundation components
3. After US1 complete:
   - Developer A: Move to User Story 3 or 5
   - Developer B: Complete User Story 2 API + frontend
   - Developer C: User Story 4 or Polish tasks
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD REQUIRED**: Verify tests fail before implementing per constitution Principle III
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All file paths are exact locations per plan.md project structure
- Bilingual (Korean/English) support required in all form-related components
- UTF-8 encoding must be enforced at database, API, and frontend levels

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 33 tasks (includes TDD tests)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Database Schema)**: 8 tasks (includes TDD tests)
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Browse/Search)**: 18 tasks (includes TDD tests)
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Add Forms)**: 19 tasks (includes TDD tests)
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Edit/Update)**: 16 tasks (includes TDD tests)
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Bulk Import)**: 14 tasks (includes TDD tests)
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: 20 tasks
- **Total**: 137 tasks

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: 6 parallel tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 19 parallel tasks
- **User Story 2**: 9 parallel tasks (models)
- **User Story 3**: 6 parallel tasks (models)
- **User Story 4**: 6 parallel tasks (models)
- **User Story 5**: 4 parallel tasks
- **Polish Phase**: 14 parallel tasks
- **Total Parallel**: ~64 tasks (47% can be parallelized)

### Independent Test Criteria

- **US1**: Run migrations, verify 9 tables created, insert sample data, query CIOMS-I form structure
- **US2**: Search forms by control number, view complete form with all sections (patient, reactions, drugs, causality, lab results)
- **US3**: Create new CIOMS-I form with bilingual data, verify persistence, check appears in search
- **US4**: Edit existing form, modify patient info and reactions, verify audit log created with old/new values
- **US5**: Upload CSV with 100 CIOMS-I forms, monitor progress, verify 95+ imported successfully with error report for failures

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Phases 1-3 (Setup + Foundational + User Story 1)

**Reasoning**: Delivers functional CIOMS-I database schema with sample data, migration scripts, and verification tests. Provides foundation for all subsequent features.
