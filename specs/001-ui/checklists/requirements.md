# Specification Quality Checklist: MedDRA Test Database & Data Entry Web UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- ✅ User stories describe value to data entry specialists, database administrators, terminology specialists
- ✅ Language is accessible to business stakeholders (e.g., "hierarchical structure", "data entry forms" rather than technical jargon)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all reasonable defaults applied with assumptions documented
- ✅ All 30 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "MUST enforce unique constraints on MedDRA term codes")
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "under 2 seconds", "10,000 records per minute", "95% success rate")
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user experience, not implementation (e.g., "users can search and retrieve" vs "API response time")
- ✅ 5 user stories with 4 acceptance scenarios each = 20+ acceptance scenarios defined
- ✅ 8 edge cases identified covering concurrency, errors, data integrity, and system limits
- ✅ "Out of Scope" section explicitly bounds the feature (10 items excluded)
- ✅ 5 dependencies listed, 10 assumptions documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to at least one acceptance scenario
- ✅ User stories cover complete lifecycle: database setup (P1) → browse/search (P2) → add (P3) → edit (P4) → bulk import (P5)
- ✅ 16 success criteria provide comprehensive coverage of database, performance, user experience, and data integrity outcomes
- ✅ Technology choices (PostgreSQL, Python, FastAPI) mentioned only in Dependencies/Assumptions sections, not in requirements

## Specification Quality Score

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

- Content Quality: 4/4 items passed (100%)
- Requirement Completeness: 8/8 items passed (100%)
- Feature Readiness: 4/4 items passed (100%)

**Total**: 16/16 checks passed (100%)

## Notes

All quality checks passed on first validation. The specification is:

1. **Complete**: All mandatory sections filled with comprehensive details
2. **Clear**: Requirements are unambiguous and testable
3. **User-focused**: Written from business/user perspective, not technical perspective
4. **Bounded**: Scope clearly defined with explicit inclusions and exclusions
5. **Measurable**: Success criteria provide concrete, verifiable outcomes

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to develop implementation plan based on this specification.

## Validation History

### Initial Validation - 2025-10-15

**Result**: ✅ All checks passed

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive 5-phase user story breakdown with clear priorities
- 30 functional requirements organized by category (database, UI, validation, import/export, security)
- Detailed entity descriptions for all 8 key entities in MedDRA hierarchy
- 16 measurable success criteria covering performance, user experience, and data integrity
- 10 documented assumptions and 5 dependencies identified
- Explicit scope boundaries with "Out of Scope" section

**No Issues Found**: Specification meets all quality standards without revisions.
