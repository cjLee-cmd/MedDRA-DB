# Feature Specification: MedDRA Test Database & Data Entry Web UI

**Feature Branch**: `001-ui`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Ïò§ÎùºÌÅ¥ÏùÑ ÎåÄÏã†ÌïòÎäî ÌÖåÏä§Ìä∏Ïö© Îç∞Ïù¥ÌÑ∞Î≤†Ïù¥Ïä§ ÏÉùÏÑ± Î∞è ÏûÖÎ†• Ïõπ UIÏ†úÏûë"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Database Schema Setup & Migration (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

As a database administrator, I need to create a PostgreSQL database with MedDRA schema structure that mirrors the existing Oracle database, so that the test environment can accurately replicate production data structures for testing purposes.

**Why this priority**: Without the database foundation, no other functionality can be tested. This is the blocking prerequisite for all data entry and retrieval operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running schema migration scripts and verifying that all tables, relationships, constraints, and indexes are created successfully. Delivers a functional database ready to accept MedDRA data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an empty PostgreSQL database instance, **When** the migration scripts are executed, **Then** all MedDRA tables (SOC, HLGT, HLT, PT, LLT) are created with proper hierarchical relationships
2. **Given** the database schema is created, **When** referential integrity is tested, **Then** parent-child relationships between terminology levels are enforced
3. **Given** the migrated schema, **When** sample data is inserted, **Then** all constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) are validated correctly
4. **Given** the database is operational, **When** querying hierarchical relationships, **Then** data can be retrieved following MedDRA's five-level structure

---

### User Story 2 - Browse & Search MedDRA Terms (Priority: P2)

As a data entry specialist, I need to browse and search existing MedDRA terms in the database through a web interface, so that I can verify data consistency and find appropriate terms before creating new entries.

**Why this priority**: Before users can add data, they need visibility into existing data to prevent duplicates and understand the current state of the database. This provides immediate value for data verification.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the web interface, performing searches by term name or code, and verifying that results display correctly with hierarchical context. Delivers read-only data access capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the web UI is loaded, **When** a user searches for a MedDRA term by partial name, **Then** matching terms are displayed with their codes and hierarchical levels
2. **Given** search results are displayed, **When** a user selects a specific term, **Then** the full hierarchical path (SOC ‚Üí HLGT ‚Üí HLT ‚Üí PT ‚Üí LLT) is shown
3. **Given** the database contains MedDRA data, **When** a user browses by hierarchy level, **Then** terms are organized and displayed according to their parent-child relationships
4. **Given** a search query returns no results, **When** the user sees the empty state, **Then** a clear message indicates no matching terms were found

---

### User Story 3 - Add New MedDRA Terms (Priority: P3)

As a medical terminology specialist, I need to add new MedDRA terms through the web interface with proper validation, so that I can maintain and expand the terminology database as medical classifications evolve.

**Why this priority**: Once users can view existing data, the next logical step is creating new entries. This enables full database maintenance capability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the data entry form, submitting new terms with valid hierarchical relationships, and verifying that data is persisted correctly. Delivers full CRUD capability for MedDRA terms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the data entry form is displayed, **When** a user enters a new MedDRA term with valid code and hierarchy selection, **Then** the term is saved and immediately appears in search results
2. **Given** a user is creating a new term, **When** an invalid parent relationship is selected (e.g., LLT under SOC), **Then** validation prevents submission and displays clear error messages
3. **Given** a user submits a new term, **When** the code already exists in the database, **Then** a duplicate error is shown and the term is not saved
4. **Given** a new term is successfully saved, **When** the hierarchical view is refreshed, **Then** the new term appears in its correct position within the MedDRA hierarchy

---

### User Story 4 - Edit & Update Existing Terms (Priority: P4)

As a data steward, I need to edit and update existing MedDRA terms while maintaining data integrity, so that I can correct errors and keep the terminology database accurate and current.

**Why this priority**: After basic CRUD operations are established, users need the ability to maintain data quality through updates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting an existing term, modifying its attributes, saving changes, and verifying that updates are reflected throughout the database while maintaining referential integrity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a term is displayed in detail view, **When** a user clicks edit and modifies the term name, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected in all search results and hierarchical views
2. **Given** a user is editing a term with child terms, **When** attempting to change its hierarchical level, **Then** validation ensures child relationships remain valid or prompts for resolution
3. **Given** a term has been modified, **When** the update transaction is committed, **Then** an audit log entry records who made the change, when, and what was modified
4. **Given** concurrent users are editing different terms, **When** both save simultaneously, **Then** all changes are committed without conflicts or data loss

---

### User Story 5 - Bulk Data Import (Priority: P5)

As a database administrator, I need to import MedDRA terminology data in bulk from standard file formats, so that I can efficiently populate the database with complete terminology sets without manual entry.

**Why this priority**: Manual entry is time-consuming for large datasets. Bulk import enables efficient database population but is lower priority than core CRUD operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading a formatted data file, monitoring the import process, and verifying that all records are created with proper validation and error reporting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid CSV or Excel file with MedDRA terms, **When** the file is uploaded through the import interface, **Then** all valid records are imported and a summary report shows success/failure counts
2. **Given** an import file contains invalid data, **When** the import process runs, **Then** validation errors are logged with specific row numbers and field issues
3. **Given** a large file is being imported, **When** the import is in progress, **Then** a progress indicator shows percentage complete and estimated time remaining
4. **Given** an import operation fails partially, **When** the user reviews the error report, **Then** successfully imported records remain in the database and failed records are listed for correction

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user attempts to delete a term that has dependent child terms?
- How does the system handle concurrent edits to the same MedDRA term by multiple users?
- What happens when database connection is lost during a data entry operation?
- How does the system handle special characters or non-Latin text in term names?
- What happens when importing a file with circular hierarchical relationships?
- How does the system respond when PostgreSQL storage limits are approached?
- What happens when a user's session expires during a long data entry process?
- How does the system handle orphaned terms (child without valid parent)?
