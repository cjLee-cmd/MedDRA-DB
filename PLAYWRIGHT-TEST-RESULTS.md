## Technical Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: IndexedDB Key Path Error
**Problem**: `Failed to execute 'add' on 'IDBObjectStore': Evaluating the object store's key path yielded a value that is not a valid key`

**Root Cause**:
- Form.create() was spreading `TEMPLATES` which included `id: null`
- IndexedDB with `autoIncrement: true` rejects explicit null id values

**Fix**:
- Removed `...TEMPLATES` spreading from all create operations
- Built objects directly with only required fields
- Let IndexedDB auto-generate id values

**Files Modified**:
- `js/models/Form.js` - Removed template spreading in create() and update()
- `js/utils/sample-data.js` - Converted Date objects to ISO strings
- `js/test-console.js` - Fixed date_received format

### Issue 2: Date Handling
**Problem**: Date objects not compatible with IndexedDB storage

**Fix**:
- Converted all `Date` objects to ISO strings using `.toISOString()`
- Applied to: date_received, date_performed, assessed_date fields

### Issue 3: Test Timing Issues
**Problem**: Tests failing due to waiting for wrong element state

**Fix**:
- Changed from generic `waitForSelector('#crud-test-result')`
- To specific text waiting: `waitForSelector('#crud-test-result:has-text("Update Form Test: SUCCESS")')`
- Ensures test waits for actual content update, not just element visibility
